## What Is This?

This system automatically checks if claims are true or false by:
1. Breaking down complex statements into simple parts
2. Searching the internet for reliable sources
3. Analyzing the evidence found
4. Providing a verdict with clear explanations

**No technical background needed to understand how it works!**

---

## Why Does This Matter?

In today's world, misinformation spreads quickly. This system helps by:
- ✅ **Automating fact-checking** - No need to manually search dozens of sources
- ✅ **Providing transparency** - Shows exactly why it reached each conclusion
- ✅ **Using reliable sources** - Prioritizes educational, government, and peer-reviewed sources
- ✅ **Explaining decisions** - Not a "black box" - you can see the reasoning

---

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

Imagine you want to check this claim:
> "The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 and is located in Paris"

Here's what happens:

### Step 1: Breaking Down the Claim
The system splits this into two simpler claims:
1. "The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889"
2. "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris"

### Step 2: Searching for Evidence
For each simple claim, it creates search queries:
- "Eiffel Tower completion date"
- "When was Eiffel Tower built 1889"
- "Eiffel Tower Paris location"

### Step 3: Checking Source Quality
It looks for reliable sources like:
- ✅ Educational websites (.edu)
- ✅ Government sources (.gov)
- ✅ Major news outlets (BBC, Reuters)
- ✅ Encyclopedia sites (Wikipedia, Britannica)

### Step 4: Making a Decision
It reads the evidence and decides:
- **SUPPORTED** - Multiple reliable sources agree
- **NOT SUPPORTED** - Sources disagree or contradictory evidence found

### Step 5: Explaining the Verdict
It tells you:
- Which sources it used
- Why it made this decision
- What evidence was most important

   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Ollama** (for free local AI)
   - Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/)
   - Install and run: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`

### Step-by-Step Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/SIDDHARTH1-1CHAUHAN/Research_Paper01.git
cd Research_Paper01/multi-agent-fact-checker

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

```

---

## Usage Examples

### Simple Command-Line Usage

```python
from src.orchestrator import FactChecker

# Initialize
checker = FactChecker()

# Check a claim
result = checker.verify("The Eiffel Tower is in Paris")

# Print result
print(f"Verdict: {result.verdict}")
print(f"Explanation: {result.explanation}")
```

### Example Output

```
Verdict: SUPPORTED

Explanation:
This claim is SUPPORTED by multiple high-credibility sources.

Evidence from 5 sources:
1. Wikipedia (wikipedia.org) - HIGH credibility
   "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France."

2. Britannica (britannica.com) - HIGH credibility
   "Eiffel Tower, Parisian landmark that is also a technological masterpiece..."

3. Paris Tourism Office (parisinfo.com) - MEDIUM credibility
   "Located on the Champ de Mars in Paris, the Eiffel Tower..."

All sources consistently confirm the Eiffel Tower's location in Paris, France.
Confidence: 95%
```
